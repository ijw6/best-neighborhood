## Description
Our metric for determining the best neighborhood gave equal weight to three different scores:

Obesity Rate - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-obesity-rates/resource/fce248f0-8697-4d2a-bbe0-2da826776bfa

Building Violation Count - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-pli-violations-report/resource/4e5374be-1a88-47f7-afee-6a79317019b4

Arrest Count - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f

Each score is relative to other neighborhood's score, so each score is given a highest possible value of 1, and is based on ranking. Adding all these scores together creates the final metric, with 3 being the best possible score (#1 in all categories).

## Abstract
We found that the neighborhood that had the best metric score was Regent Square, a surprising pick, and not one many other groups found to be the best. One strong feature of Regent Square is its small size, which may indicate that our metric favored smaller neighborhoods, and goes to show that the factors in a metric can be subjective and misleading.
